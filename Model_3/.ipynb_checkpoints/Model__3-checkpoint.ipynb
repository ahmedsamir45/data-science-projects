    "## Context : Predict behavior to retain customers.( Churn Or Not)\n",
    "## Content : \n",
    "Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes , The data set includes information about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn \n",
    "- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies\n",
    "- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges\n",
    "- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents\n",
    "\n",

    "   - InternetService:Customer’s internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, No)\n",
    "   - OnlineSecurity:Whether the customer has online security or not (Yes, No, No internet service)\n",
    "   - OnlineBackup: Whether the customer has online backup or not (Yes, No, No internet service)\n",
    "   - DeviceProtection: Whether the customer has device protection or not (Yes, No, No internet service)\n",
    "   - TechSupport: Whether the customer has tech support or not (Yes, No, No internet service)\n",
    "   - StreamingTV: Whether the customer has streaming TV or not (Yes, No, No internet service)\n",
    "   - StreamingMovies: Whether the customer has streaming movies or not (Yes, No, No internet service)\n",
    "   - Contract: The contract term of the customer (Month-to-month, One year, Two year)\n",

    "   \n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**1- Load data and features are numerical ( discrete, continuous, or timeseries based ). (data Path =`WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn_2.csv`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**2-  Use visualization to drive that churned clients have lower range in TotalCharges**\n",
    "\n",
    "**3- Based on your observations from First requirement :**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Check outlier in continuous Features \n",
    "   - Check Missing values and Handle it\n",
    "\n",
    "**4- Extract The Most important feature based on Mutual information**\n",
    "\n",
    "**5- Use DecisionTreeClassifier to predict customer churned and show why your model can decide customer churn**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hint: \n",
    "- you can consider any empty string as missing values \n",
    "- you are free to apply any method to address any necessary data transformations and cleaning procedures"
